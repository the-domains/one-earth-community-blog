  Humans and killer whales have so much in common that the latter are now
  serving as a model for our species by showing how ecology, culture and
  evolution reveal themselves in genomes. Both killer whales, also called orcas,
  and humans are two of the world's most cosmopolitan animals, given that both
  include subgroups that migrated and quickly diversified from an ancestral
  population likely due to climate change.

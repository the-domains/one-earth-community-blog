  African lions get, well, the lion's share of attention-but some would be
  surprised to learn there's another subspecies of the big cat in Asia. The
  Asiatic lion once roamed vast swathes of the Middle East and Asia, but
  indiscriminate hunting and killing to protect livestock led to their mass
  slaughter.By the late 1800s, as few as ten of the animals remained on Earth.

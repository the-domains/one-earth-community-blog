  The origins of superstitions can be hard to pin down. There are often several
  theories about how they started, and a bunch of people ready to debunk those
  theories. Friday the 13th is one such example. If you read Dan Brown's The Da
  Vinci Code , you might remember learning that members of the Knights Templar-a
  medieval society-were arrested on Friday the 13th.
